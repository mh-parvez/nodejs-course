# 🔐 Is a MAC or Tag the Same as a Digital Signature?

## ❓ The Question

Can we call a **MAC (Message Authentication Code)** or the **tag** it produces a *digital signature* of the message?

---

## 🧠 Short Answer

**Technically, no** — a MAC is **not** the same as a digital signature.

But in **practical use cases**, you’ll sometimes see MACs (especially HMACs) referred to as "signatures" — for example, when **signing cookies** or **API requests**. This is common terminology, even though the underlying cryptographic concept differs.

## 🔍 Key Differences Between MAC and Digital Signature

| Feature | **MAC / HMAC** | **Digital Signature** |
|--------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Key Type** | Shared **secret key** | **Public-private key pair** |
| **Purpose** | Ensures **integrity** and **authenticity** | Ensures **integrity**, **authenticity**, and **non-repudiation** |
| **Cryptography** | **Symmetric** | **Asymmetric** |
| **Verification** | Only parties with the **shared secret** can verify | Anyone with the **public key** can verify |
| **Non-repudiation** | ❌ No — sender can deny the message | ✅ Yes — signature proves sender’s identity |

## 🧾 Why MAC Is Not a True Digital Signature

A **digital signature** proves that only the holder of a **private key** could have signed the message. It offers **non-repudiation**, meaning the sender can’t deny signing it.

A **MAC**, on the other hand, is created using a **shared secret key**. Since both the sender and receiver have the key, either party could have created the MAC — which means there’s **no proof of authorship**.

## 💬 So Why Do People Call It a Signature?

In **many real-world systems**, HMACs are used for *message signing* — for example:

- **Signing cookies** in web applications
- **Signing API requests** in systems like AWS, Stripe, etc.
- **JWTs (JSON Web Tokens)** with HMAC algorithms like `HS256`

In these cases, the term *"signature"* is used **informally**, meaning:  
> *“We’re attaching a cryptographic tag to verify the data hasn’t been tampered with.”*

### 🔐 Important Note:
In these examples, the **secret key is known only to the server** (not shared with the client).  

- The **server generates the MAC (or HMAC)** when sending data (like a cookie or JWT).
- Later, the **server verifies** it again using the same secret key.

So even though it's **symmetric cryptography**, the key is **not truly shared** — it belongs to **one party only** (the server).  
That’s why this usage **feels similar to a digital signature**, even though it's not technically the same.

## ✅ When to Use What?

- Use **MAC / HMAC**:
  - When **both parties trust each other**
  - In systems where **speed and simplicity** are important
  - For **API authentication**, **cookie signing**, **JWTs (with HS256)**

- Use **Digital Signatures**:
  - When **public verification** and **non-repudiation** are required
  - In **email signing**, **software distribution**, **blockchain**
  - With JWTs using `RS256` or `ES256`

---

## 🧠 Summary

- A **MAC** (like HMAC) is **not** a true digital signature, but in practical applications, it’s often **used like one**.
- It ensures the message **hasn’t been tampered with** and came from someone with the **secret key**.
- For **non-repudiation**, **use digital signatures** based on public-private key cryptography.
