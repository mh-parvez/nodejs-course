# 🌈 Rainbow Tables and Rainbow Table Attacks

## 🔍 What is a Rainbow Table?

A **Rainbow Table** is a precomputed lookup table used to reverse cryptographic hash functions — primarily to crack password hashes.

It contains a large list of **plaintext inputs** (like common passwords) and their corresponding **hash outputs**.

Instead of hashing each guess during an attack, the attacker just searches the table — making the process very fast.

## ⚠️ What is a Rainbow Table Attack?

A **Rainbow Table Attack** is when an attacker uses a rainbow table to:

- Look up the **hash of a stolen password** (e.g., from a database breach).
- Match it against known hash entries in the table.
- Retrieve the original **plaintext password**.

This works **only** if:

- The hash function used is known (e.g., SHA-1, SHA-256).
- No **salt** was used during hashing.

## 🛡️ How to Prevent Rainbow Table Attacks

1. **Always use a salt**: A unique random salt per password ensures that even the same password has a different hash.
2. **Use KDFs**: Functions like PBKDF2, bcrypt, scrypt, and Argon2 make hashing slow, which makes precomputation expensive.
3. **Avoid plain SHA-256/MD5** for password storage — they are fast and vulnerable to brute-force + rainbow tables.

## 🌐 Popular Websites to Crack Hashes

Here are three popular websites that can help crack hash values:

1. **[CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/)** — A powerful online hash cracker with a large lookup table (15GB+). Supports MD5, SHA1, SHA256. Easy to use and fast for common hashes.

2. **[Hashes.com](https://hashes.com/)** — A community-driven hash cracking service. You can upload hash lists, and it will try cracking using a massive collection of known hashes.

## 🔚 Conclusion

Rainbow tables are powerful tools for attackers — but they’re only effective if the hash is unsalted and predictable.

**Best defense: salt + slow hash + strong password policy.**
