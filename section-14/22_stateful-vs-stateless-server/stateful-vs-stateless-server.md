# Server-Side Session Types: DevOps Perspective

In the context of DevOps and server architecture, server-side sessions can be categorized into two major types based on how tightly they are coupled with the server instance:

---

## üü© Server-Coupled Sessions (Stateful Server)

These session types **store user session data on the same server instance** that handles the request. This creates a dependency on that specific server, making the application **stateful** and harder to scale horizontally.

### 1. In-Memory Session
- Stores session data in server memory (RAM).
- Very fast but volatile.
- Lost on server restart.
- Not suitable for multi-instance deployments.

**Example:** `express-session` with default `MemoryStore`

---

### 2. File-Based Session
- Stores session data in files on the local server disk.
- More persistent than memory, but slower.
- Still tied to a single server instance.
- Difficult to scale horizontally.

---

## üü¶ Server-Decoupled Sessions (Stateless Server)

These session types **externalize the session data** to a shared database or cache system (like MongoDB or Redis). While the application still maintains state, it is **no longer tied to a specific server instance**, and is therefore considered **stateless** from a DevOps and scalability perspective.

### 3. Database-Backed Session
- Stores session data in a central database (e.g., Redis, MongoDB, PostgreSQL).
- Shared across all instances of the application.
- Scalable and fault-tolerant.
- Common in production environments.

**Examples:**
- Redis session store (e.g., `connect-redis`)
- MongoDB session collection

## Summary Table

| Type             | Coupled to Server | Scalable | Persistent | DevOps Classification |
|------------------|-------------------|----------|------------|------------------------|
| In-Memory        | ‚úÖ Yes            | ‚ùå No   | ‚ùå No     | Stateful Server        |
| File-Based       | ‚úÖ Yes            | ‚ùå No   | ‚úÖ Yes    | Stateful Server        |
| Database-Backed  | ‚ùå No             | ‚úÖ Yes  | ‚úÖ Yes    | Stateless Server       |

For scalable and resilient architectures, **Server-Decoupled (stateless)** sessions are preferred in modern DevOps practices.
