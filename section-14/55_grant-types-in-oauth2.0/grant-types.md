# What are Grant Types in OAuth 2.0?

A grant type is a way for a client to request authorization and receive tokens. It determines how the client authenticates itself and/or the user.


## Common OAuth 2.0 Grant Types

OAuth 2.0 defines several grant types, each designed for specific use cases and client types. Here's a comparison table summarizing the most common ones.

| Grant Type                  | User Involved? | Client Type         | Use Case                         | Security Level | Notes                                                 |
| --------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `authorization_code`        | ✅ Yes          | Confidential        | Web apps with backend            | 🔐🔐🔐         | Most secure; uses `client_secret`                     |
| `implicit` ⚠️ Deprecated    | ✅ Yes          | Public              | SPAs (legacy)                    | ❌              | Tokens in URL; now deprecated in OAuth 2.1            |
