# ❌ Why You Should Not Use JWTs for Login Sessions

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are often marketed as a modern solution for authentication. While they are useful in some contexts (like stateless service-to-service communication), **they are not ideal for client-server login authentication** — especially when used in place of traditional session management.

## 🚫 Core Problems with JWT-Based Login Sessions

### 1. **Inability to Revoke Tokens Easily**
JWTs are **stateless** and **self-contained**, meaning:
- Once a token is issued, you **cannot invalidate it** unless you maintain a separate revocation list.
- This defeats the whole point of statelessness.

### 2. **Token Theft = Full Access**
If a JWT is stolen (via XSS, network leak, etc.):
- It gives the attacker **full access until it expires**
- No way to destroy it unless it expires or you manually track it in a DB/Redis (which reintroduces state)

### 3. **No Rotation or One-Time Use**
- JWTs do not have a built-in rotation system.
- Refresh tokens can mitigate this, but that’s extra complexity and doesn't solve the root problem of statelessness.

### 4. **Token Bloat**
- JWTs often contain embedded user data.
- These large tokens are sent **on every request**, bloating headers and impacting performance.

### 5. **Not Built for User Sessions**
JWTs were designed to **convey claims between parties**, not to **manage authentication sessions**.
- They are ideal for **federated identity** (e.g., OAuth/OpenID Connect)
- Not for managing a user’s "logged-in state" on your app

## ✅ When Should You Use JWTs?

Use JWTs when:
- You need **stateless** authentication across microservices
- You're building **federated identity systems** (e.g., Google/Facebook login)

## ✅ Better Alternative: Server-Side Sessions

Use traditional **session IDs** stored in cookies:
- Easily invalidated (just destroy the session in DB)
- No sensitive user data stored on client
- Less risk of misuse
- Works beautifully with `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on cookies

## ⚖️ Summary

| Use Case                        | Should You Use JWT? |
|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| Login/auth sessions              | ❌ No               |
| Stateless service-to-service auth| ✅ Yes              |
| OAuth/OpenID identity tokens     | ✅ Yes              |
| Client-side session management   | ❌ No               |

## 🧠 Final Thought

JWTs are a powerful tool — but **only when used in the right context**.  
For login sessions, traditional **cookie-based sessions with server-side storage** remain **more secure, simpler to manage, and easier to revoke.**
