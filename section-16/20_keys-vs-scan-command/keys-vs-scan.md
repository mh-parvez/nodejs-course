# Keys vs Scan Command in Redis

## Overview

In Redis, both `KEYS` and `SCAN` commands are used to search for keys. However, they are designed for very different purposes and have important performance and safety implications.

---

## `KEYS` Command

### 🔹 Description:

* Returns **all keys** matching a given pattern.
* Example:

  ```bash
  KEYS user:*
  ```

### ✅ Pros:

* Simple to use.
* Good for **development** and **small datasets**.

### ❌ Cons:

* **Blocks the Redis server** while scanning all keys.
* Not safe in production for large datasets.
* Can cause significant performance issues.

### ⚠️ Use Case:

* Only in **development** or when you are absolutely sure the dataset is small.

## `SCAN` Command

### 🔹 Description:

* Iteratively scans keys in **small batches** using a cursor.
* Non-blocking and safe for production.
* Example:

  ```bash
  SCAN 0 MATCH user:* COUNT 10
  ```

### ✅ Pros:

* **Non-blocking**, does not freeze Redis.
* Can be used safely in **production environments**.
* Allows partial, incremental scans.

### ❌ Cons:

* Requires cursor management (`do...while` or loop).
* Returns **partial results** per call (you must loop until cursor is `0`).

### ✅ Use Case:

* Scanning keys in **production**.
* Cleaning up expired or orphaned keys.
* Exporting or analyzing subsets of data.

## Summary Table

| Feature              | `KEYS`                  | `SCAN`                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Blocking             | Yes (dangerous in prod) | No (safe in prod)              |
| Returns all keys     | Yes                     | Eventually (through iteration) |
| Pattern matching     | Yes                     | Yes                            |
| Recommended for prod | ❌ No                    | ✅ Yes                          |
| Syntax simplicity    | ✅ Easy                  | 🔁 Needs loop & cursor mgmt    |

## Final Recommendation

> Use `KEYS` only in controlled environments or development.
> Always prefer `SCAN` for safe, scalable key iteration in production systems.
